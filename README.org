* Description

A [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ZoneMode][Zone Mode]] where elves will work on behalf of you, like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon][Doraemon’s]] gadget
“小人ロボット” or “The Elves and the Shoemaker” in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms%27_Fairy_Tales][Grimm's Fairy Tales]].

** Motivation
Recently, to increase productivity, work efficiency is seriously
valued in Japan.
The “evolution”, which is called “働き方改革” and in charge of increasing
productivity, is propagated unstoppably by the government.

For example, in Japan, minister of information technology is trying to achieve
codevelopment of digital transformation(DX) and stamps(“印鑑”), whereas
stamps(“印鑑”) are regarded as outdated or inefficient generally(*1).
Also, almost all of companies use faxes(“ファックス”), which are ancient
communication tool using thermo-sensitive paper, on almost all of deals
to reassess true value of faxes(*2).

I am living in Japan 🗻.
And I really like the sence of Japanese that respect traditions and
conserve their country. As a human(？じしんないですよ👼) that has residence
status, I want to contribute to productivity of Japan and I create
this repository.

This repository(elves.el 🌼🌼) takes a hint from “The Elves and the Shoemaker”
in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms%27_Fairy_Tales][Grimm's Fairy Tales]]. This program will work on behalf of you(me).
When you are sleeping, elves may complete your(my) tasks of tomorrow.
Elves(and I) do not have human rights and are not restricted
by *any* laws(e.g. “労基法”).
So you can contribute to Japanese productivity without any effort!

This program may yet contain defects and Elves may yet produce incomplete code.
I'll make effort with elves to contribute to Japanese productivity. And I
respect Japanese openness so PRs are welcome!

By the way, I quote the name of “elves” from “某 衰退”. Elves of “某 衰退” are
very very かわいいの and I respect COOL JAPAN(which are referred as “かっこいい
ニッポン”(*3)) and I ようせいいさんだいすきいいいいいです.

** 閑話休題
This is just a joke program. I 萌える this sort of programs that do not seriously
contribute to GNU and GDP.

Japan って何回書いたかな？
