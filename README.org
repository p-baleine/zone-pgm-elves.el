#+TITLE: elves.el

* Description

A [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ZoneMode][Zone Mode]] where elves will work on behalf of you, like the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon][Doraemon’s]] gadget
“小人ロボット” or “The Elves and the Shoemaker” in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms%27_Fairy_Tales][Grimm's Fairy Tales]].

** Motivation
Recently, to increase productivity, work efficiency is seriously
valued in Japan.
The “evolution”, which is called “働き方改革” and in charge of increasing
productivity, is propagated unstoppably by the government.

For example, in Japan, the minister of information technology is
trying to achieve codevelopment of the digital transformation(DX)
and stamps(“印鑑”), in spite of obsolescence of stamps(“印鑑”)(*1).
Also, almost all of companies in Japan are using telefacsimile machines
(Fax, which is called “ファックス” in Japan), which is an ancient
communication tool using thermo-sensitive paper(*2), on almost all of
deals to reassess true value of telefacsimile machines(*3).

I am living in Japan 🌅.
And I really like the sence of Japanese that respect traditions and
conserve traditions of their country. As a human(？) that has residence
status at Japan, I want to contribute to productivity of Japan and
I create this repository.

This repository(/elves.el/ 🌼🌼🎉) takes a hint from “The Elves and the
Shoemaker” in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimms%27_Fairy_Tales][Grimm's Fairy Tales]].
This program will work on behalf of you(me).
When you are sleeping, elves may complete your(my) tasks of tomorrow.
Elves(and I) do not have *any* human rights and are not regulated
by *any* laws(e.g. “労基法”).
So, together with /elves/,  you can contribute to Japanese productivity
without any effort!

This program may yet contain defects and elves may yet produce incomplete code.
I am going to make effort with /elves/ to contribute to Japanese productivity.
And I respect Japanese openness so PRs are welcome! ✨🎉🎉

By the way, I quote the name of “elves” from “某 衰退”. Elves of “某 衰退” are
very very かわいいの and I respect COOL JAPAN(which are referred as “かっこいい
ニッポン”(*4)) and I ようせいいさんだいすきいいいいいです.
